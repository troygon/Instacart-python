Python scripts for Instacart project

Instacart is a real company but data used in this project is mixed using real data directly from Instacart, and some are generated for this learning project. Instacart is an online grocery store app that has very good sales but wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns.

As a data analyst, I did an initial data exploratory analysis of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on provided criteria.
